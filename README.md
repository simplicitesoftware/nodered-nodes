To add these nodes to your NodeRED instance you just need to add this dependency to its `package.json` install it:

```json
"dependencies": {
   "node-red-contrib-simplicite": "latest"
}
```

Also make sure that your NodeRED instance use a recent Node.js engine:

```json
"engines": {
   "node": ">=4.4"
}
```
